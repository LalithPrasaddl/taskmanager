# Basic Task Manager

This project provides a simple flow of CRUD of tasks. This project stores all the tasks in local storage,
which helps in retaining the tasks for a longer duration.
The project does not have any backend or server integration. All of the implementation is purely Client side.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
